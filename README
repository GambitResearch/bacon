Bacon - slice it and dice it!
=============================

Bacon is a library implementing an OLAP cube. It operates on a sequence of
Python objects of every type, exposing generic attributes called "labels" and
numeric attributes called "measures" and allows an user to perform queries,
filtering and aggregating along labels and accumulating measures.

Bacon offers facilities to "drill down" interactively, generating a query from a
previous query, reducing the dimension of the dataset until it can be
visualized, e.g. to two dimensions to show on a grid or one dimension for a
graph plotting.

Bacon is designed to operate on pre-aggregated data with the assumption that the
dataset will fit in memory: it is database-agnostic and doesn't try to optimize
database queries.

Bacon doesn't deal with Idols of the Mind, nor with figurative painting.
